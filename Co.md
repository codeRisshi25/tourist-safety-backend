Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System using AI, Geo-Fencing, and Blockchain-based Digital IDDescription

  

  

Problem Statement

  

This problem statement proposes the development of a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System that leverages AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing technologies. The system should include:

  

  

Digital Tourist ID Generation Platform

  

- A secure blockchain-based system that issues digital IDs to tourists at entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts).

- These IDs should include basic KYC (Aadhaar/passport), trip itinerary, and emergency contacts, and be valid only for the duration of the visit.

  

Mobile Application for Tourists

  

- Auto-assign a Tourist Safety Score based on travel patterns and area sensitivity.

- Geo-fencing alerts when tourists enter high-risk or restricted zones.

- Panic Button with live location sharing to nearest police unit and emergency contacts.

- Optional real-time tracking feature (opt-in) for families and law enforcement.

  

AI-Based Anomaly Detection

  

- Detect sudden location drop-offs, prolonged inactivity, or deviation from planned routes.

- Flag missing, silent, or distress behaviour for investigations.

  

Tourism Department & Police Dashboard

  

- Real-time visualizations of tourist clusters and heat maps of high-risk zones.

- Access to digital ID records, alert history, and last known locations.

- Automated E-FIR generation for missing person cases.

  

IoT Integration (Optional)

  

- Smart bands or tags for tourists in high-risk areas (e.g., caves, forests).

- Continuous health/location signals and manual SOS feature.

- esp32, gps, iot device -> phone -> server

  

Multilingual Support

  

- App and platform available in 10+ Indian languages and English.

- Voice/text emergency access for elderly or disabled travellers.

- translation

  

Data Privacy & Security

  

- End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws.

- Blockchain ensures tamper-proof identity and travel records.

  

Background

  

In regions like the Northeast, where tourism is a key economic driver, ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount. Traditional policing and manual tracking methods are insufficient in remote and high-risk areas. There is a pressing need for a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, rapid response, and secure identity verification for tourists, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

  

  

Expected Solution

  

A robust digital ecosystem comprising:

  

- Web portal and mobile app for tourists and authorities.

- AI/ML models for behaviour tracking and predictive alerts.

- Blockchain-based ID generation and verification.

- Real-time dashboards for police/tourism departments.

- Optional IoT wearable integration for enhanced safety.

- Automated alert dispatch and evidence logging systems.

Structure 

in  an [[itinerary]] there will be location options or fields, when the user submits the itinerary -> each of the location is then geo-encoded and stored in our database and then it is matched with co-ordinates of other table [[High-risk or restricted zones]] , each high risk zone is marked with various intensity of risk and for each location in the itinerary if any comes under risk zone then points are deducted and reduces

itinerary

Structure will be like

First thing would be an option to select from which date to which the trip would be of

then the options would appear for each day, and for each day if one is filled then the 2nd empty option would pop out and so on, then for the 2nd day

```

{

"trip_name": "Meghalaya Adventure",

"start_date": "2025-10-20",

"end_date": "2025-10-25",

"days": [

{

"day": 1,

"date": "2025-10-20",

"Time": 08:30 IST

"locations": [

{"name": "Umiam Lake"},

{"name": "Shillong City Center"}

]

},

{

"day": 2,

"date": "2025-10-21",

"Time": 18:20 IST

"locations": [

{"name": "Laitlum Canyons"},

{"name": "Elephant Falls"}

   ]

    }

  ]

}

```

  

# High-risk or restricted zones

A data Structure made by the police by specifying co-ordinate zone, for eg points are marked on the map then a trinagle of zone will form connecting the points and any cordinate on it would be marked as zone

zone can be of different intesity

max a scale of 10 to 1, and an option to mark a label on it

another one would be a restricited zone which would have the max points and is a very danger area

for now we will be just using the json sample structure as our database tables

  

lets talk about our backend now, only the things we are doing now would be discussed nothing else

  

Show thinking

Of course. As the backend developer for this project, here's a detailed plan focusing specifically on the Node.js implementation for the features you're working on now.

### **Backend Technology Stack**

This is the foundation we'll build upon:

- **Framework:** **Express.js** – It's a robust and minimalist framework for Node.js, perfect for building our RESTful APIs.
    
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** with the **PostGIS** extension. While a standard NoSQL database could work, PostGIS is specifically designed for geographic queries (like checking if a point is inside a polygon), which is essential for our geo-fencing and safety score logic. It will be far more efficient than manual calculations.
    
- **Real-time Communication:** **Socket.IO**. This library is ideal for handling the live location sharing for the Panic Button and the optional tracking feature. It provides a reliable, real-time, bi-directional communication channel between the client (React Native app) and our server.
    
- **Authentication:** **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. We'll use JWT to secure our API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can submit itineraries or send alerts.
    
- **Geocoding:** We'll need a service to convert location names (e.g., "Umiam Lake") into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). We can use a library like **node-geocoder** which supports providers like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap.

### **Database Schema (Data Models)**

Here are the simplified PostgreSQL table structures we'll need for the current features.

1. **Users**
    
    - `id` (Primary Key)
        
    - `name` (String)
        
    - `email` (String, Unique)
        
    - `password_hash` (String)
        
    - `emergency_contacts` (JSONB) - e.g., `[{"name": "Dad", "phone": "1234567890"}]`
        
    - `tracking_enabled` (Boolean, default: false)
        
2. **Itineraries**
    
    - `id` (Primary Key)
        
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
        
    - `trip_name` (String)
        
    - `start_date` (Date)
        
    - `end_date` (Date)
        
    - `safety_score` (Integer) - Calculated and stored after creation.
        
3. **ItineraryLocations**
    
    - `id` (Primary Key)
        
    - `itinerary_id` (Foreign Key to Itineraries)
        
    - `day` (Integer)
        
    - `time` (Timestamp)
        
    - `location_name` (String)
        
    - `coordinates` (GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326)) - Stores the geocoded lat/lon.
        
4. **RiskZones**
    
    - `id` (Primary Key)
        
    - `zone_name` (String) - e.g., "Landslide Prone Area"
        
    - `risk_level` (Integer, 1-10)
        
    - `is_restricted` (Boolean)
        
    - `zone_geometry` (GEOGRAPHY(Polygon, 4326)) - The geographic boundary of the zone.

### **Core Logic and API Endpoints**

This is how we'll implement the main features.

#### **1. Itinerary Submission & Safety Score Calculation**

This flow is triggered when the user submits their trip plan from the React Native app.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/itineraries`
    
- **Request Body:** The JSON structure you defined for the itinerary.
    
- **Backend Process:**
    
    1. **Validate Input & JWT:** The endpoint will first verify the user's JWT token.
        
    2. **Geocode Locations:** For each `{"name": "Location Name"}` in the itinerary, our backend will call the geocoding service to get its latitude and longitude. We should implement caching here to avoid repeatedly looking up the same location.
        
    3. **Create Itinerary Record:** An entry is created in the `Itineraries` table.
        
    4. **Store Locations:** For each geocoded location, a corresponding entry is created in the `ItineraryLocations` table, linked to the new itinerary.
        
    5. **Calculate Safety Score:**
        
        - Initialize `safety_score` to 100.
            
        - For each location in `ItineraryLocations`, run a PostGIS query: `SELECT risk_level FROM RiskZones WHERE ST_Contains(zone_geometry, 'SRID=4326;POINT(lon lat)');`
            
        - This query checks if the location's point falls inside any polygon defined in our `RiskZones` table.
            
        - If a location is in one or more risk zones, we deduct points from the `safety_score`. The formula could be simple, e.g., `safety_score -= risk_level * 2`. If it's a restricted zone, we can deduct a large fixed number, like 50 points.
            
    6. **Update and Respond:** The calculated `safety_score` is saved to the `Itineraries` table. The final itinerary object, including the score, is sent back to the frontend.
        

#### **2. Geo-Fencing and Real-Time Tracking**

This requires the app to periodically send its location to the backend.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/users/location`
    
- **Request Body:** `{ "latitude": 12.34, "longitude": 56.78 }`
    
- **Backend Process:**
    
    1. **Validate JWT:** Authenticate the user.
        
    2. **Geo-Fence Check:** The backend takes the received coordinates and runs the same `ST_Contains` query against the `RiskZones` table.
        
    3. **Trigger Alert:** If the user enters a risk zone, the backend triggers a **push notification** (using a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging) to the user's device with an alert message like, "Warning: You are entering a high-risk area."
        
    4. **Log for Tracking:** If `tracking_enabled` is true for the user, their location is logged with a timestamp. This data will power the dashboard for law enforcement or family members.
        

#### **3. Panic Button (Real-Time with Socket.IO)**

This is where Socket.IO becomes critical. This is not a standard REST API endpoint.

- **Socket.IO Event:** `panic_alert`
    
- **Backend Process:**
    
    1. **Client-side:** When the tourist presses the panic button, the React Native app emits a `panic_alert` event to our Socket.IO server, sending the user's ID and current location.
        
    2. **Server-side (`connection` event):** Our server listens for this event.
        
    3. **Create a "Room":** Upon receiving the `panic_alert`, the server creates a unique Socket.IO room (e.g., `panic_room_{userId}`).
        
    4. **Notify Authorities:** The server immediately finds the nearest police unit (based on the tourist's location) and sends them an alert (via the Police Dashboard, which will also be connected via Socket.IO). It also sends SMS/push notifications to the user's emergency contacts.
        
    5. **Broadcast Live Location:**
        
        - The tourist's app will start emitting their location every few seconds via a `location_update` event.
            
        - The server listens for `location_update` and broadcasts these new coordinates to everyone in that user's specific panic room.
            
        - The police dashboard and any authorized family members will receive these coordinates in real-time, allowing them to track the tourist on a live map.
            

okay so lets start some concepts, i get an itinerary from the user, with multiple locations, the location we get are in words so we need to geo encode it, since a location name can match with multiple names we will constrain it to only in the state of assam
